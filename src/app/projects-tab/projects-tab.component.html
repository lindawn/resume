        <p>
           My team focused on building a platform that used Stellar, an online network for storing and moving money, to help globalize startup funding. The hackathon was a really humbling experience, as we got to meet so many people working on impressive projects that pushed the limits of the technology available. Personally as a software engineer, I was very motivated to keep working on my personal skills to develop as quickly and precisely as the peers I met there.

        <h2>Data Viz Hackathon</h2>
        <h5>March 1 2020</h5>
        <p>
           This one-day hackathon brought together students and professionals various backgrounds, as part of NYC's Open Data week. My team scraped FDNY's Twitter account for their responses to building fires, and formed a heat map to reveal worrying trends that confirmed the arson epidemic in the Bronx.

            This prooject was motivated by our team lead, a member of the NY Red Cross who identified the inability to provide emergency accomodations for victims of building fire due to the ineffective distribution of resources, as an issue that could be solved with data viz.

        <h2>NUS Makerthon 2019 - Alfred</h2>
        <h5>Programmer, Dec 2018 - Jan 2019</h5>
        <p>
            Alfred is my Makerthon team's RasPi robot, designed to help children with limited mobility move objects
            around their desks. By making use of Python libraries (RpiGPIO, numpy, pyaudio, OpenCV etc. ), we
            implemented I integrated computer vision, voice controls, and switch controls. Working with a cross-faculty
            team was especially rewarding, since I had the opportunity to practice design thinking and assembly of
            hardware components from my team mates of design and engineering faculties.

        <p>
            As part of a module project, I developed an Android application that adjusted prices of food based on the
            nutritional intake of NUS students, to encourage healthy eating.
            Information was encoded in QR, and prices were customised prices for each student. The MPAndroid library was
            used to visualize their weekly nutritional intake.

        <h5>Fullstack Development Project, Jan 2019 - May 2019</h5>
        <p>
            I led a team of 4 in a fullstack web and mobile application development project using
            Java EE SDK and Angular, for a module on enterprise systems interface design and development.
            LiqCrative was an alcohol subscription box service with different tiers, created with the
            intention of lowering costs for budding mixologists, while sending them unique craft liquors in sample-sized
            volumes.
