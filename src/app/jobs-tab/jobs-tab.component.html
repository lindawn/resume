        <h2>Boxed, New York</h2>
        <h5>Fullstack Intern, January-March 2020</h5>
        <p>
            At Boxed, my team worked on developing an ad platform, which would help advertisers on our platform place,
            bid for, and manage advertisements for their campaigns.
            My internship was unfortunately cut short by the pandemic, but I had learnt a great deal in the 3 months. As
            a fullstack developer, this internship gave me the opportunity to develop beyond my inclinations towards
            frontend work. Having the flexibility to insert myself at various parts of the development process
            (designing interface, implementing api calls, data migrations, etc.) was a welcome challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Projects were developed using React-Apollo-GraphQL stack, with Postgres db using the Hasura console, and
            Docker.

        <h5>UI Design Intern, December 2019</h5>
        <p>
            The diversification of food delivery applications, mobile, and card payments managed by different payment
            gateways had left cashiers to use different consoles to process payment. Moreover, the POS systems widely
            used in Singapore are clunky and costly, require manual backups, and hardly have optimized UI. The Waffle
            startup aims to modernize the POS systems into an integrated system that provides a great user experience
            for cashiers and managers, by integrating various payment gateways, sales data analytics, and flexible menu
            updates, to an iOS application.
        </p>
        <p>My internship here let me develop my UI design skills by translating client requirements into the application
            layouts, in quick and successive iterations.</p>

        <h5>Web Developer, Summer 2019</h5>
        <p>
            Tetsuyu Healthcare is a health-tech company that aids home caregivers and nurses through their software
            suite.
            I joined the team as a technical writing intern, but initiated the modernization of the
            <a href="https://tetsuyuhealthcare.com/">company website </a>
            using ReactJS. This included coordinating and executing the video and photo shoots, finished with the
            necessary editing. <br />

        <p>
            Secondarily, my team collaborated with A*STAR on pre-processing data to train a ML model at recognizing
            various wound tissues as part of the Cares4Wounds development.

        <h5>Service Staff, age 16-forever</h5>
        <p>
            Taking up various service jobs since the age of 16, and working in customer service, has helped in
            developing communication skills with diverse people, that is hard to come by in the typical Singaporean
            university experience. Working closely with my managers have also given great insight in dealing with
            different personalities, that have shaped my inter-personal skills at the work place.
