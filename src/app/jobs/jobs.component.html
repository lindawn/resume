                    <h4>Ackcio, Software Engineer</h4>
                    <h6>(Apr - Dec 2020)</h6>
                    <p>Ackcio is a startup that provides industrial remote monitoring solutions; low-powered robust
                        networking hardware that withstand harsh weather conditions.
                        I worked on the client-facing .NET Core application that runs on a RasPi, initiating critical
                        data visualization features to help clients optimize performance by identifying the path taken
                        by packets in the network.
                        Limited to the Pi's computing power and a 3.6v battery, I honed my skills in optimizing software
                        performance down to energy consumption.

                    <p>
                        At Boxed, my team worked on developing an ad platform, which would help advertisers on our
                        platform place,
                        bid for, and manage advertisements for their campaigns.
                        My internship was unfortunately cut short by the pandemic, but I had learnt a great deal in the
                        3 months. As
                        a fullstack developer, this internship gave me the opportunity to develop beyond my inclinations
                        towards
                        frontend work. Having the flexibility to insert myself at various parts of the development
                        process
                        (designing interface, implementing api calls, data migrations, etc.) was a welcome challenge.

                        Projects were developed using React-Apollo-GraphQL stack, with Postgres db using the Hasura
                        console, and
                        Docker.

                        The diversification of food delivery applications, mobile, and card payments managed by
                        different payment
                        gateways had left cashiers to use different consoles to process payment. Moreover, the POS
                        systems widely
                        used in Singapore are clunky and costly, require manual backups, and hardly have optimized UI.
                        The Waffle startup aims to modernize the POS systems into an integrated system that provides a
                        great user experience
                        for cashiers and managers, by integrating various payment gateways, sales data analytics, and
                        flexible menu

                        Tetsuyu Healthcare is a health-tech startup that aids home caregivers and nurses through their
                        software
                        suite.
                        Here, I initiated the modernization of their <a href="https://tetsuyuhealthcare.com/">company
                            website </a>
                        by completely redesigning it in accordance with Tetsuyu's image, and built with ReactJS. This
                        included coordinating and executing the shoots for the website's media content, professionally
                        finished with editing softwares.

                        In addition, I led the interns' team in the collaboration with A*STAR on processing data to
                        train the machine learning imaging model to recognize wound tissues as part of Cares4Wounds
                        technology.
