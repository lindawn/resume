                    <h4>Yeetvent (NUS Capstone Project)</h4>
                    <p>
                        The culmination of the software development modules in NUS was in my capstone project, where my
                        team of 6 designed and developed an extensive
                        event resources management platform. Yeetvent had 3 distinct interfaces to the same database; an
                        organizational-facing interface for event managers, venue providers, and service providers to
                        pool resources;
                        a public-facing interface for event-goers to browse and purchase tickets for events; and an
                        admin interface to manage the platform. Each of these interfaces have complete and extensive
                        features, designed with the end user behaviour in mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The system's backend was built with JavaEE, exposed as RESTful API services, while the user
                        interfaces were designed on Figma, and implemented in ReactJS. It also incorporated frontend
                        libraries that handled complex functions such as auto-generated calendar scheduling, map
                        rendering of locations, and reactively generated event listings.

                    <h4>Android Health Food App (IS3261)</h4>
                    <p>
                        As part of a module pair project, we developed a health tracking application which dynamically
                        changes the price on food items available at the school canteen for each student, based on their
                        purchase history, to encourage a healthier lifestyle. The mobile application obtained food item
                        information based on a QR code
                        generated based on JSON data. The item's health index was
                        determined by the macronutrients requirements of the student's customizable profile.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The system was built with a local SQL database, and the application was developed on Android
                        Studio (Kotlin), incorporating the Highcharts library.

                    <h4>Alfred (NUS Makerthon 2019)</h4>
                    <p>
                        Developed by a cross-faculty team of 4, Alfred is the name of the Raspi desk robot built to help
                        people of limited upper body mobility (focus on muscular dystrophy) navigate a large work
                        surface, exending their reach further. The idea was to help reduce the need for a caregiver's
                        constant presence, which could be inconvenient and demoralizing for our target users.
                        Alfred comprises of a series of small mobile trays, which are moved by the robot. Caregivers can
                        place drinks, devices, and other necessities on the trays on the table, which would be brought
                        to the user by the robot unit.
                    </p>
                    <p>This project was built on a Raspberry Pi, with hardware directly interfaced in the GPIO pins. The
                        commands given to the robot were in the form of voice commands, processed by an open source
                        voice recognition python library, while the trays' positions were identifed through the OpenCV,
                        and a custom visual code attached on the trays.
