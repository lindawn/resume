										<h5>Software Engineering Intern, Summer 2019</h5>
										<p>
											I developed the company website using <b>ReactJS</b> for a professional
											public image. This
											included
											coordinating and executing all video and photo shoots, followed by editing
											with
											Lightworks and GIMP respectively.
											<br />

											I also played the role of a <b>technical writer</b>, and
											facilitated technical communication through product documentation to better
											align
											product vision to development milestones.

											<br />
											We had a collaborative project with A*STAR, on which I was in charge of the
											other
											interns at my company. Using Azimut (by A*Star), we classified tissues in
											wound images to
											pre-process data for machine learning.
											To improve efficiency, I implemented efficient file management system to
											enhance efficiency
											by 3-fold using Excel

										<h5>Programmer, Dec 2018 - Jan 2019</h5>
										<p>
											Alfred is my Makerthon team's RasPi robot, designed to help children with
											limited mobility
											move things around their desks.
											As the only computing student in my team, I integrated computer vision,
											voice controls, and
											switch
											controls into a Raspberry Pi robot using Python Libraries (RpiGPIO, numpy,
											pyaudio, OpenCV
											etc) to empower children with limited mobility.
											<br />
											This process was extremely rewarding, as I learnt about
											design thinking and assembly of hardware components from my team mates of
											design and
											engineering faculties.
											We are looking to continue working on this project during the term break.

											<p>
							
												As part of a module project, I developed an Android application that helped to automatically
												adjust prices of food based on
												the nutritional intake of NUS students. It made use of QR Codes to read json files and
												extract and process data within the application,
												to determine customised prices for each student, to encourage a balanced diet. I also made
												use of the MPAndroidChart library to track the nutritional Information
												of the students to give them feedback on their nutritional intake.

												I led a team of 4 in a fullstack web and mobile application development project using

												LiqCrative was an alcohol subscription box service with different tiers, created with the
												intention of lowering costs for budding mixologists,
												while sending them unique craft liquors in sample-sized volumes.
												The backend of the software was built in Java EE, while the front end was built with Java's
												PrimeFaces (Admin panel), and Angular (customer-facing application) with RESTful web
												services.

						I am a third year Information Systems student at the National University of Singapore (NUS),
						with a
						strong interest in designing products that work for people and leave them with positive
						experiences.
						I like working through complexities of problems in a given context, and designing elegant,
						efficient, and complete solutions.
					</p>
					<p>
						During my course of study at NUS, I had the opportunity to learn the processes behind
						building
						companies’ technological infrastructures, providing me with essential skills to work in this
						industry. My course also teaches us about the way technology and businesses are integrated,
						giving
						me invaluable insights into the complicated relationships that form the network effects of
						the
						markets today.
					</p>
					<p>
						Being a detail-oriented person by nature, I believe I am someone who has a critical and
						analytical
						view of things. I am someone who stays extremely committed to a task when I am convinced
						that it
						will work out. I also value collaborative work, since I like to exchange ideas with people
						in a
						team. As such, I have developed the skills of working effectively in teams, by keeping
						communication
						channels open, and keeping all members on track. However, I will admit that I am not the
						fastest
						learner when it comes to new technologies, since I have always approached learning with
						foundations
						first. However, I am not daunted by a steep learning curve – instead, I enjoy taking on
						challenges
						and break them down into manageable modules.
